Name your MVP “Group ___ MVP.”  You are allowed to use bullet points!

What problem is your project trying to solve? 
(What audience is it for? How will your project solve the issue?)
Spotify users save a lot of songs, but it is time consuming to differentiate them into different playlists. Our project will provide convenience for Spotify users to organize their saved songs.

What features make up your MVP (Minimum Viable Product)?
(What features do you hope to accomplish by the end of the semester?)
Differentiate saved songs based on their mood.

What are some additional features outside the MVP?
(A list of features that would be nice to add after finishing the MVP.)

Organize the saved songs into different playlists that match with their genre and mood.
Create user interface that can take in people’s playlists / saved songs and spit back the songs organized into playlists based on their moods

Which does the tech stack look like and why did you choose these over alternatives? 
(Feel free to discuss with your PM! Examples: React, Python, Java, etc. You do not need to know how to use these right now.)
Python : it is a programming language good for data science and language 
Js :  help us to access spotify API 

What will the project timeline look like?
(Discuss this with your PM as well! You don’t have to stick to it, but this should give you a general guideline for how the project should progress.)
During spring break we’ll take time to familiarize ourselves with Js and Python using online tutorials if we haven’t learned them already
First meeting after spring break: discuss the logistics of organizing songs
From there, we will design our algorithms and run test cases
Towards the end of our timeline, we will aim to create a user friendly interface so that our product can be applicable to anyone and everyone
